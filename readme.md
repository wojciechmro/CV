## Experience

### 4BSystems
**LLM-focused API Engineer**  
*July 2023 - Present (4 months)*  
- Leveraging Vector Database (`chromadb`) and LLM (`gpt`/`llama2`) to develop a Retrieval Augmented Generation (`LangChain`, `LlamaIndex`) based chatbot with proprietary data and custom logic.
- Staying up to date with the latest developments in the field of LLMs and NLP ([AIDevs2](https://www.aidevs.pl/) and [gen-ai](https://gen-ai.pl/) courses + [Alpha Signal](https://alphasignal.ai/) newsletter).

### Bayoo (previously [Explainer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bayoo.explainer))
**Technical Co-Founder**  
*September 2022 - September 2023 (1 year 1 month)*  
- Developed mobile app for parents and their kids to create fairy tales together with ease and enjoyment. 
- Used low-code tools (`Flutterflow`, `Glide`, `Adalo`, `Zapier`, `Firebase`) and Python code (`Google Cloud Functions`) to create a fully functional app.

### Kozminski University
**Lead Author in Prompt Engineering [Research Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DuZw_BG603ZJn9x5dUolzzsAFFXiT4Fe0ZE8B48V3pM/edit?usp=sharing)**  
*January 2023 - July 2023 (7 months)* 
- With [Leon Ciechanowski Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciechanowski/) and [Dariusz Jemielniak Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jemielniak/) we explored how prompt engineering can influence response length consistency in `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- Used variety of statistical tools for analysis like `Coefficient of Variation` as well as `Shapiro-Wilk`, `Levene`, `Kruskal-Wallis` and `Wilcoxon Signed-Rank` tests.
- Found that quantitative length-defining keywords (those that specify a number, such as a word or character count) in prompts tends to generate more consistent but often lengthier outputs.
